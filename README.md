# skypy-launcher
This is a cool little minecraft launcher made with python using the minecraft-launcher-lib module library.

## features
Now this launcher has been scientifically proven to be better than other launchers. Not only because it has less bloat but also because of the following features:
- no bloat (ofc)
- no spyware or malware (it's open source ofc no malware)
- very lightweight
- custom .minecraft folder
- custom uuid and token support
- cracked + premium account support
- open source
- based
- based x2

## faq
- "What version/edition of minecraft is it for?"
It's for minecraft: java edition only and in the launcher there's a dropdown from where you can choose the version that you want.
- "How can I get the token?"
Although it might not be usable in the future you can follow these steps to get the token: https://kqzz.github.io/mc-bearer-token/
- "Will it affect my current game data?"
No it won't affect any game data since it currently uses a custom .minecraft folder that's located inside the running folder of the launcher, however if you want to then you can change the directory to the default one however if there are no versions installed (the one you will run) then it will surely give an error.

## future plans
Since you just saw all the reasons to use this launcher, here are the things I want to do in the future/the stuff I've completed:
- [] proper gui
- [] no bugs
- [] custom mod support
- [] microsoft login (using tokens rn)
- [] the ability to use the .minecraft folder in AppData without custom profile issues
- [] pyTer integration

Well enjoy!
